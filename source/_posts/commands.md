# shell 命令


- diff -urNa dir1 dir2
    - 说明: 对比两个文件夹 diff
    - 参数解释: 
```shell
-a  Treat  all  files  as text and compare them     
    line-by-line, even if they do not seem to be text.
-N, --new-file
    In  directory  comparison, if a file is found in
    only one directory, treat it as present but empty
    in the other directory.
-r  When comparing directories, recursively compare
    any subdirectories found.
-u  Use the unified output format.
```
